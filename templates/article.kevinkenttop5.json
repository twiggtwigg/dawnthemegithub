One challenge is that they can be a bit heavy for some home users. Professional chefs love a longer knife, sometimes as long as 300mm, because the extra blade makes big jobs easier. Extra length makes a bigger fulcrum and you need less force to cut….or something sciency like that. If that sounds like you, these are my recommendations for longer knives that are still nicely balanced.</p>"

Fujimoto Nashiji knives are made with high-performance carbon steel, clad in a protective layer of softer stainless steel. This means they cut like crazy, but require a lot less care than a full carbon-steel knife. The best of both worlds! The team of craftspeople who make them are each an expert in a different step of the process, meaning you get a crazy good knives for a very reasonable price.
