Make sure you pick up a <a href=\"/products/charcoal-chimney-bbq-starter\" title=\"Charcoal Chimney BBQ Starter\">chimney starter</a> regardless of the charcoal you use, and grab a pair of <a href=\"https://knifewear.com/products/king-tong-36cm-tweezers\">King Tong</a> so you can easily move the charcoal around your grill. </p>"
