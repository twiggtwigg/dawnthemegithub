It has a European knife's weight but cuts with Japanese precision because it's thinner and made of harder steel than its counterpart. It feels familiar in your hand while still leveling up your knife game. A beauty conceptualized by Tomo-San and his apprentice Sayaka-san, the only female blacksmiths that we’ve met in Japan!<\/p>",

It’s full white carbon steel, laminated in a softer carbon, so you have to make sure you keep the whole blade clean and dry. The kurouchi finish is uncommon to the knives of Oul Sakai, but our request turned out rad! Add to that a super slick polished choil and spine, and it’s an absolute delight to hold. <\/p>",

The core is made of Aogami Super, one the hardest carbon steels used in Japanese kitchen knives, forged by Fujiwara-san, a true Master. The 195 is a unique size, and the finger-notch makes it fit like a glove. I recently bought myself one of these, so yo Ice Cube! Get at me, and let’s have a Chopped battle.<\/p>",
