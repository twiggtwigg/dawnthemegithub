It is similar but diferent to the seasoning that occurs on a cast iron pan.<\/p><p>The best and easiest way to get a patina is to use your knife! Keep a cloth near your work surface, and when you notice the steel changing colour, give it a wipe before it turns orange. Just like a leather jacket your knife will wear in and develop a patina with time. A strong patina is earned, a badge to be proud of!<\/p>",
