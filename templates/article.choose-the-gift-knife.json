Classy layers of steel and dimpled hammering let the person holding it know that they are about to accomplish something impressive at the stove. VG-10 stainless steel is perfect for kitchen knives and is a favourite of many talented knifemakers like Tomoo Matsumura-san in Tsubame-Sanjo or the retired great, Anyru-san of Takefu Knife Village. Haruyuki santokus are a hair longer than most others—an amazing chef’s knife for bigger hands.</p>",

Made by Takeshi Saji in Fukui, these are a santoku-shaped Cadillac. You’ll be hard pressed to find a knife that cuts smoother while looking so good. The distinguished ironwood handle, mosaic pin and brass bolster make this knife perfect for the sherry-drinking, cigar smoking folks in your life.</p>",

A nakiri—this rectangular blade is perfect for slicing veggies, leaves, and herbs because the entire edge comes in contact with your cutting board—say goodbye to red pepper snowflakes and scallion chains. Seki Kanetsugu is one of a few makers that can draw a short line from their kitchen knives to swordmaking, in 2018 they celebrated 100 years in business. The super thin blade makes short work of most produce and the unique heptagonal handle makes quite the talking point.</p>",

            "text": "<p>An all purpose knife like a santoku, but a touch longer and a bit pointier. Gyutos are perfect for that person who loves a French-style chef’s knife—the length allows for easier “rock chopping” and doubles as a carving knife in a pinch. Similar to the other Masakage on our list, this knife is a carbon & stainless steel hybrid, meaning it's not too hard to care for if you’re paying attention. Kato-san named this beauty <em>Yuki</em>, after the Japanese word for snow; there’s something about that pillowy Nashiji finish and white magnolia handle that scream Miracle on 34th Street.</p>",

Haruyuki does a wicked job of putting together fantastic knives and keeping the cost down — this knife ticks all of the badass boxes — black, textured finish, big enough for an outrageous squash, and red lightsaber sharp.</p>",

Get a proper carving knife! Dads love knives that look like swords, it’s a fact. Picture yours (or one you know) at the head of the table behind a Norman Rockwell quality bird holding a gleaming slicer from Seki Kanetsugu; the SG2 steel is going to float through the meat and the 62 layers of damascus look incredible doing it.</p>",

Just like meats and veggies, good bread deserves a fantastic knife. The perfect stocking stuffer has two types of serration on one blade; itty bitty teeth near the tip for cracking through crunchy crusts, and rounder smoother teeth for getting a smooth slice. I’d grab one for everyone I knew if I were you.</p>",
