It’s made with a Shirogami #2 carbon steel core with stainless steel cladding, and I love this combo because it’s perfect for someone who wants a super sharp edge that re-sharpens easily. Plus, the stainless cladding makes it easier to take care of compared to a full carbon steel knife; only the edge of the Nishiki needs to be kept dry to prevent rust. Despite being high carbon steel, it has a more robust edge that makes it a great workhorse. I also love the cherrywood and blonde pakkawood combo on the handle. For some reason, it makes me think about fresh spring air!<\/p>",

The Kokuen, meaning ‘black smoke’, has quickly become a staff favourite; made with SLD semi-stainless steel, it’s super easy to care for and takes an awesomely sharp edge. I love the Kokuen because they are so thin that they glide through dense carrots and potatoes like nothing. They also have a nice tall profile for my people who like to chop without catching their knuckles on the counter. The dark, smoky finish makes you drool when you look at it, not to mention the reddish-brown ebony handle with a gorgeous water buffalo collar. Make cutting your dense veggies an easy-breezy dream with the Kokuen!<\/p>",

You need to check on the Fujimoto Nashiji; it’s another staff favourite and beloved by folks looking for their first knife while sticking to a budget. Fujimoto knives are hand-made by a group of artisans that roll-forge their knives, giving many of the benefits of a forged knife in a super consistent, cost-effective package. This knife kicks ass in both professional and home settings, and is great if you want to dip your toes into using carbon steel knives. The core steel, Aogami #2, is less quick to rust than Shirogami (white) carbon steel. Much like the Nishiki, a layer of protective stainless on either side of the blade help keep maintenance down to the very edge of the knife.<\/p>",

They used to make knives, swords, farm tools and all other kinds of tools for a feudal lord in Japan. That is just so cool. The Ishime line screams badass with the rock-like finish. This ‘Ishime’ look is normally reserved for their hunting knives, but they do it just for Knifewear because we asked nicely. This knife is perfect for someone looking for that extra dose of cool, sexy carbon steel that you can tell your friends about. Just ask Sam in the Calgary store, and he’ll convince you that you need to collect all the Moritaka knives. <\/p>",

With this super sexy damascus and hammered ‘tsuchime’ finish on the blade, you’re gonna be obsessed every time you take it out to cut something. The tried and true VG10 stainless steel makes for one awesome entry-level knife that feels like a steal of a deal at a very reasonable price. This santoku will be on your list for wedding season for that jaw-dropping present that makes you the best relative at the party.  <\/p>",

First of all, it’s so stunning with that damascus finish, and stabilized Poplar wood handle. Those two elements give the Oukokuryu the edge above the rest, not to mention it’s made of a super hard high-tech stainless steel called SG2. Amazing for someone looking for that black pearl to add to their collection. Did I mention that Oukokuryu means Shining Black Dragon? Now that's way to cool.

The Tojiro Child’s Santoku will give them (and you) the confidence they need to get started. This knife has a sharp edge that will make cutting cheese, veggies and fruit super easy with a rounded tip for safety. The handle is even rubberized for an easier grip! It’s also a great blade for adults, I love it for folks who are curious but kind of nervous to get a full-size knife. I gave it to my older sister, who loves it since that is all she needs to make some awesome meals. <\/p>",
